// The term « predicate » comes from mathematics. In programming it refers to a function which
// returns either true or false.We can imagine that predicates are like questions.Usually we name;
// such functions as questions.Higher - order functions may take predicates as input; one of such functions is the filter, defined as a method on the Array object.;
